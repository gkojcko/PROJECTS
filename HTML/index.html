    Mangastic Mangaka team, is dedicated to creating engaging stories and artwork that fascinate readers and at the same time  bring our ideas to life.
    We strive to push the boundaries of what is possible.

   Through our work, we hope to inspire others to pursue their dreams and take risks in their artistic pursuits. Our team is made up of four individuals
   each one with diffrent experineces. We strongly believe that this diversity is our strength. We bring our ideas to the table by collaborating
   in order  to create something truly special and unique.

    we always strive to create the best possible work that we can. We are excited to continue exploring the world of manga and comics, and we look
    forward to sharing our work with readers around the world in the ComicDom!
