#  ACTIVE DIRECTORY SETUP GUIDE

### During our studies at IEK AKMI we were asked to create our own Active Directory / Domain Controller. The task was quite challenging since we did not have any previous experience in this field , however with a lot of work and effort we made it happen.
###   Since we managed to set it up we thought that it would be a good idea to make a step-by-step tutorial/guide on how we did it , so as to help our fellow co-students or anyone who's intrested on the same venture.
